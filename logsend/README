The log sender
==============

This utility collects logs for the syslog buffer, filters them for the output
of just the relevant daemons and uploads them to the server.

It is expected the `logsend.sh` will be run periodically on each of the
routers. The `logsend.cron` file can be used for that.

The `whatsnew` is a tool that remembers what lines of the log were already sent
and filters them out, so they are sent only once.

The `upload.cgi` is a script that sits on the server and concatenates the logs
from the clients. It authenticates the data by checking the HMAC provided with the data.
