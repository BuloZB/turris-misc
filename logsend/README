The log sender
==============

This utility collects logs for the syslog buffer, filters them for the output
of just the relevant daemons and uploads them to the server.

It is expected the `logsend.sh` will be run periodically on each of the
routers. The `logsend.cron` file can be used for that.

The `whatsnew` is a tool that remembers what lines of the log were already sent
and filters them out, so they are sent only once.

The `upload.cgi` is a script that sits on the server and concatenates the logs
from the clients. It does not do any kind of authentication. It is expected
that the web server will be configured to at least restrict the access to the
ones inside the VPN.
