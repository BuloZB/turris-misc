The watchdog script
===================

A simple script that is expected to be run periodically in a short interval
(once every few minutes, for example, usually from cron) to check that a set of
daemons is alive.

If a daemon listed as required is missing two times in a row, the corresponding
service (in /etc/init.d) is restarted. It is not restarted the first time,
since it might be shut down for upgrade, for example.

The list of daemons is at the top of the script.
