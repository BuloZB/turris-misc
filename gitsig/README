Git GPG checkers
================

This directory contains a few tools to check signatures on git commits.

Setup
-----

All these tools use separate gnupg home with the trusted keys. They expect the
directory to be $HOME/git-gpg. It may be possible (and better from security
point of view) if some of the files weren't writable by the current user, to
ensure malicious attacker can't add another key into the keyring.

Unsigned detector
-----------------

The `unsigned_detect.pl` tool is meant to be run periodically (for example
after each push). It goes through the repository it is run in and reports any
new commits from listed email addresses that are not signed by a trusted key.
If any such commits are found, it signals this by terminating with exit code 1.
