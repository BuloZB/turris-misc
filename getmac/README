getmac
================

This utility enables to OS get MAC addresses from ATSHA204 crypto chip, where
are the addresses stored.

This is not meant for main firmware of Turris router, but for the rescue
partition. System in rescue partition has limited size and it is desirable to
provide this ability without all of the dependencies of standard implementation
in main firmware.
