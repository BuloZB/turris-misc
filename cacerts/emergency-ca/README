The emergency CA
================

In case anything else fails, the updater trusts this one additional authority.
It is trusted by the updater only, so its use would be to install updates that
make everything allright again.

Note that the private key is not included in the git repository, only in the
complete version stored offline in a safe deposit box.

To use it, this must be performed:
 * Run the getkey. A new key is created, together with a certificate. Use that
   one on the web server.
 * Run getcrl. A crl file is created. Place that so it is served on the right
   spot (https://api.turris.cz/crl).
 * Release updates that make sure everything works after getting back to the
   real certificate authorities.
 * Revoke the key.
 * Pack the CA directory back to the safe deposit box (when generating
   certificates, some files are modified and must be preserved before the next
   use).

Note that while the CA has 10 years validity, the CRT 1 year, the CRL is only
valid for 7 days. So it needs to be re-generated often for the time we use the
emergency CA.
