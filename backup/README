Here are various scripts that help backing up the databases and maintaining
them.

Currenty, we have these:

backup-turris::
  Backs up the main turris database from db.turris.cz to archive.turris.cz, in
  a strongly encrypted form. This should be run from cron.

store-backup::
  A forced command for SSH, on the receiving side. This will accept the data
  and store it into a file. This is configured with a key in .ssh/authorized_keys.

purge-backups::
  This is run on archive.turris.cz, to clean up old database backups.
