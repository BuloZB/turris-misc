Daemon that stores network throughput into a ringbuffer, so user can request a
graph of activity some time back.

Daemon generates every 3 second CSV-like file /tmp/network with timestamped
values of some interesting indicators.

There are few types of rows:

<timestamp>,network,<interface_name>,<received_bytes>,<transmitted_bytes>
	- Source: /proc/net/dev
	- Unit: bytes

<timestamp>,cpu,<current_load>
	- Source: /proc/loadavg

<timestamp>,memory,<memtotal>,<memfree>,<buffers>,<cached>
	- Source: /proc/meminfo
	- Unit: kbytes

<timestamp>,temperature,<board>,<cpu>
	- Source: I2C thermometer
	- Unit: Â°C

<timestamp>,fs,<used>,<evailable>
	- Source: command df
	- Unit: 1k-blocks
