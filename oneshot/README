Oneshot
=======

Utility for making sure a script is run exactly once. Whatever is in the
scripts directory and installed on the turris router, it is run the first time
oneshot is run since then. Then oneshot notes it was run and never runs it
again.

It is expected the scripts whose effect is already included in the image are
noted not to be run as well, by whatever installs them.
